	<p>I am a first year graduate student at UC Davis. I am broadly interested in topology.
	<br>I also completed my undergraduate degree at UC Davis. I wrote my
	<a href="OgamiUndergraduateThesis.pdf">senior thesis</a> on the fundamental group of complex curves, advised by 
	<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~lstarkston/">Laura Starkston</a>.</p>
	<p> I am a teaching assistant for Math 108 this quarter. </p>
